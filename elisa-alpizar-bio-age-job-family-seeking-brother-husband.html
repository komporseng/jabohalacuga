Well, Elisa Alpizar is here to break this stigma and it’s all featured on TLC’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Seeking Brother Husband</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Elisa Alpizar Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Elisa Alpizar On Seeking Brother Husband</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Enough with shows like </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sister Wives </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>or </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Seeking Sister Wife</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that follows a polygamous family with one husband and multiple wives. It’s time for women to have fun! In </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Seeking Brother Husband</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, the ladies are the ones who will be adding or at least try to marry more husbands to expand their polyandrous family.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Our star, Elisa Alpizar was one of the four wives featured on the show.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“There’s definitely, like, a double standard. When a female has multiple partners, it’s, ‘Oh my gosh, she’s such a slut. She sleeps around,’” she shared. “They assume [with] multiple male partners, it’s just about sex. That’s definitely not it.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Other ladies featured alongside Elisa were Kenya (married to Carl, and Tiger), Kim (married to Dustin and Vinson), and Chara (married to Patrick and Noble).</span></p><h3><b>Mike Onorato And Elisa Alpizar Relationship Details</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Elisa Alpizar first met at the 2015 Lightning in a Bottle festival on a random Saturday. She recalled that she attended the event with her best friend, Amanda Ayres, and saw Amanda conversing with Mike when Flume, an artist, was about to start his set. So, as she made her way to them seeking an opportunity to strike up a conversation, the set had already begun and she couldn’t introduce herself.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Elisa and Mike were next to each other throughout the whole performance. But too nervous to make the first move, neither dared to utter a word. Thankfully, Amanda noticed it and pushed Elisa towards Mike, who saved her from falling just in time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thereafter, the two danced throughout the show under the purple lights before Mike initiated the kiss. It was “pure magic,” Elisa recalled. “As soon as we met, it was like we were inseparable. I mean, we had fallen in love.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fast-forward to September 2018, the lovebirds then tied the knot in Huntington (Beach wedding), and in 2020 they moved to the Hollywood region of Los Angeles to pursue their dreams and an ideal lifestyle.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But though this looked like an ideal relationship, Elisa was hiding a big secret from Mike. In a confessional, Elisa said she cheated on Mike while they were dating — not because she was unhappy, but because she&nbsp; just had this “really intense connection with somebody else.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She also added that time in their relationship was difficult. “It was like, Why do I feel this way about this other person if our relationship is so good? I didn’t know at the time that we can have a great relationship and I can still like somebody else,” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, when the truth came to light, overcoming her infidelity was difficult for the pair. But ultimately, the duo decided to stay together with Mike accepting to letting Elisa pursue multiple partners. “I had to ask myself questions: Do I want to stay with her to pursue multiple partners? Or do I want to break up with her? I decided to stay with her and just grow from there,” he explained&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, the two are four years into marriage. Elisa commemorated their 4th anniversary on IG on August 28, 2022, with a post captioned, “Time is so freakin weird you guys! It does not feel like it’s only been 4 years since we got married. It feels like so much longer, and I mean that in the very best way.”</span></p><h3><b>Elisa Alpizar Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Elisa Alpizar was 33 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Seeking Brother Husband</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, she was a year younger when she filmed the show.</span></p><h3><b>Elisa Alpizar Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Elisa Alpizar comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her mother, Ramona Mitchell Alpizar is a Retired Registered Nurse. She used to work as a Manager/Business Partner at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mission Hospital</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her father Hartzell Alpizar, they taught and coached track and field athletes at L.B. Jordan High School from 1971 to 1987.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ramona and Hartzell turned 66 and 75 in 2022. They celebrated their 35th marriage anniversary in August 2016, and Elisa takes them as an inspiration. “Your love is such an inspiration! I know you have had your ups and downs, but the fact that you are still together now is incredible. I hope someday I am just as happy with my future husband as you two are now,” she dedicated a FB to them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, talking about her brother, Mark Alpízar was a Music Director at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Vermont Youth Orchestra Association</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. He is an </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Arizona State University </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>graduate who lived in&nbsp; Burlington, Vermont.</span></p><h3><b>Is Elisa Alpizar On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>_elisa.janelle</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>elisa.alpizar</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>_elisa.janelle</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Elisa Alpizar Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Elisa Alpizar is a model, actress, and podcaster. She’s appeared as “Milzenial Maia” on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Coronaville</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2011), “Amber Solomon” on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Escape to the Cove</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2021), and “Evil Kitty” on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hell’s Kitty</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2019).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her time as a podcaster, she’s the host of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Poly+Amor=Us Podcast</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. There, she and her husband Mike discuss how they decided to open up about their relationship, what it is like to be married and poly, their dating experiences, and so much more.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides podcasting, she also offers peer support sessions for those who are new to polygamy. “It usually starts with a feeling, and then blossoms into something more. It’s confusing when you discover you are polyamorous or ethically non-monogamous. Sometimes you need to talk to someone who gets it! Someone who has been where you’ve been. Someone who has made the mistakes and learned from them,” she said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her education, she attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>California State University </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>for her Bachelor of Arts (in Theater Arts) and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Art of Acting Studio Professional Conservatory</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Elisa Alpizar Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>By 2023, Elisa Alpizar garnered a net worth of under $500 thousand.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Elisa Alpizar From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Elisa hails from Mission Viejo, California.
