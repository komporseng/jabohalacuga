Those clubs are taking the pain this year and will not be deferring payments to most players, as under the AFL’s standard plan (3.5 plus 5 per cent cut).</p><p>These clubs took different approaches to the standard cuts of 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent for contracted players, with those contracted for next year getting the 5 per cent restored in their pay for next year. The overall salary cap cut due to the pandemic was about 9 per cent for 2021.</p><p>Some clubs are counting on the AFL retaining the current deal for the player payments. This year, the player payment limit – including the capped marketing deals (additional service agreements) – is $13,165,950.</p><p>Next year, assuming there is no further cut due to a troubled AFL economy, the player payments are slated to be $14,769,322 – an increase of more than $1.6m on this year’s pay, but the clubs have already factored this figure into their contracting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.252%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/c8c65ab77c97dec0eaa7f923f5987d2a1719ec68><p>The Eagles told their players that they would not bring in players on significant contracts unless they lost players – a pledge that was made when they asked for the 7 per cent cut.</p><p>St Kilda, which requested an even bigger cut than West Coast, did not make any such commitment to their players. The Saints have brought in a number of seasoned recruits, headed by Brad Hill, Zac Jones, Dougal Howard, Dan Butler and <a href=#>Jack Higgins</a>, but the Sunday Age has been unable to verify their salary cap situation heading into 2022. They have long been interested in reuniting Max King with his Gold Coast-based twin Ben King, in what would be an expensive acquisition if it ever came to pass.</p><p><span class="_2wzgv D5idv _3lVFK"><span class=_29Qt8></span><span class=_3qqDc>Loading</span></span></p><p>Fremantle and Sydney, perhaps surprisingly, did not have room to bring in seasoned recruits in the 2020 trade period, with the <a href=#>Swans having to offload Aliir Aliir</a> to make space for ex-Eagle ruckman Tom Hickey.</p><p>The Dockers are expected to remain somewhat restricted entering the next trade period, but their salary cap space is set to open up from 2022 (post season).</p><p>Sydney has been under salary cap pressure for some years, in no small measure due to the Lance Franklin contract, under which “Buddy” is due close to $1.5m this year and $1m next year, the final year of his nine-year deal.</p><p>Expansion teams GWS and Gold Coast remain tight in their player payments, despite the former <a href=#>losing Jeremy Cameron</a> and Zac Williams but with question marks on free agent <a href=#>Josh Kelly and whether he will take up a massive eight-year commitment</a> from the club.</p><p class=_2g0-m>Jake Niall is a Walkley award-winning sports journalist and chief AFL writer for The Age.</p><h2 class=_2qhpu>Most Viewed in Sport</h2><p><span class="_2wzgv D5idv _3lVFK"><span class=_29Qt8></span><span class=_3qqDc>Loading</span></span></p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno5a5or7YZpqaqF2osLC%2BxGaroZ1dlrOtecKlrJurXam1osCMnaZmmZ6ZeqW7za1koZmmmnqzu86mZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shaquill-griffin-brother-shaquem-griffin-age-gap-and-family-tree.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shaquill Griffin Brother Shaquem Griffin: Age Gap And Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicki-minaj-skeng-drops-likkle-miss-remix-says-dancehall-need-this.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicki Minaj &amp;amp; Skeng Drops &amp;quot;Likkle Miss Remix&amp;quot; Says &amp;quot;Dancehall Need This&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
