Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=30_Days_Off_Alcohol>30 Days Off Alcohol</span></h2><p>On 6 December 2018, Bree shared a blog post in which she shared her experience after she took 30 days off of drinking. There were two reasons why she took a month off drinking. The first was related to her physical health as she suffers from IBS for which alcohol is a big irritant for her.</p><p>The second reason is related to her mental health. Since turning the legal drinking age, the longest Bree has gone without having an alcoholic beverage was two weeks. That was in 2017, post-wild-open-bar-10-days-straight-TIFF-party-madness. Bree committed to one month and caved after two weeks!</p><p>Before that, the longest she had gone without alcohol was 10 days. It was when she came down with a nasty respiratory infection that she couldn’t kick. Likewise, Bree has been in lots of relationships where booze is a huge part of her bonds.</p><p>Bree didn’t realize how ingrained alcohol was in her past relationships until she started dating Bryan. Though he enjoys drinking occasionally, Bree was blown away when the two started seeing each other. 75% of the time they spent together was 100% sober. It was a shocking realization for Bree.</p><p>She had a first date where she didn’t go home tipsy, feeling the warm fuzzies, but not sure if it was from all that wine or because she liked the guy. Her relationship with Bryan completely changed her relationship with alcohol in relationships. Not needing booze to loosen up enough to fully express oneself, or feel confident enough in an unfamiliar setting with new people. This was all after meeting Bryan and staying in love with him.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Bree stands tall at a <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 57 kg. But her other body measurement details like her chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, etc are not available at the moment.
