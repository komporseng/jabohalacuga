Newcomb passed away. Following a brief bout with sickness, Mr. Danielson – Thomas H. Newcomb, age 60, passed away on September 9, 2019. He was a dedicated husband, father, grandpa, and friend to all those whose lives he touched. As we share this information with you, it is with the utmost regret that we do so. His close family and friends, who loved him very much, were there to comfort him in his final moments before he died away. On February 9, 1959, Tom Newcomb was born in the town of Willimantic, Connecticut. his birthplace was in Connecticut. His mother and father were named Elizabeth (Hinckley) Newcomb and Harold Newcomb.</p><p>The day that Tom Newcomb finally tied the knot with Linda Newcomb, the woman he had loved his entire life, was April 16, 1983. Others who will carry on his legacy include his cherished grandchildren, Lillian and Rory, as well as his son, Thomas Newcomb, and his wife, Amanda. His legacy will be carried on by these individuals. In addition to his brother William and his wife, Karen Newcomb, he is also accompanied by his nephews Trevor and Dana, as well as their respective families. In addition to having a profound respect for life, Tom made the most of each and every day.</p><p>He was an avid hunter and fisherman, but the time he got to spend with his child, making memories, was something he treasured the most. During the weekends, he would go out with his friends, whom he thought of as his family, and try out different restaurants, breweries, and vineyards. He considered them his family. The many excursions that Tom and Linda did with their good friends Lyn and Roland, Dale and Deb, and Buck and Coo were filled with happiness and laughter. These trips happened rather frequently. The period that Tom spent working at Comtran Cable was a source of great pride for him. He enjoyed a prosperous career.</p><p>His long-term professional goal of achieving the position of Vice President of Operations was finally realized after he exerted a great deal of effort over the course of a number of years.&nbsp;Along the way, he was able to cultivate wonderful friendships with the many different people he teamed up with in his professional life.<br>The words that Tom spoke came from the very depths of his heart, and he never failed to have a smile on his face. If you were to ask someone who knew Tom to describe him, the word “good man” would be the response that would have the highest probability of being given by that person.</p><p>The excitement that he exuded was contagious, and he had the power to completely transform the ambiance of every space that he entered. There will be a gathering to honor his life that will take place at Hank’s Restaurant in Brooklyn, Connecticut on Monday, September 23, 2019, from five o’clock in the evening to eight o’clock in the evening. The loss of his life will be sadly grieved, but the individuals whose lives he touched will make sure that his legacy continues on.
