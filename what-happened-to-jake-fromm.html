Fromm was a successful quarterback at Georgia, leading the team to the College Football Playoff National Championship in his freshman year. He was later drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft but was released in August 2021. Fromm then joined the New York Giants' practice squad and may potentially make his first NFL start on Sunday against the Chargers due to injuries to the Giants' starting and backup quarterbacks.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fromm's collegiate success at Georgia led to high expectations for his NFL career. However, his poor showing at the combine and the cancellation of Georgia's Pro Day due to the pandemic hurt his chances of being drafted earlier. Fromm's completion percentage also dropped in his junior year, possibly due to a tired arm, weak receivers, a struggling offensive line, and questionable play-calling.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite these setbacks, Fromm's past success and intelligence should not be overlooked. He excelled in the 2011 Little League World Series and scored high on the Wonderlic test. Fromm's decision to leave after his junior year was surprising, but it may have been influenced by his dissatisfaction with college. In hindsight, it's unclear if staying for his senior year would have been beneficial.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>After being released by the Bills, Fromm returned to Athens and is now a homeowner, husband, and finance student. He is still staying in shape and hopes to continue playing football if the opportunity arises, but he is also preparing for a career outside of football. Fromm led Georgia to the national championship game in 2018 but ultimately did not win. He does not regret his decision to leave for the NFL after the 2019 season but wonders what could have happened if he had returned for the 2020 season.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Now, with the possibility of making his first NFL start on Sunday, Fromm's career may take a new turn. The Giants' other options at quarterback include Brian Lewerke from the practice squad. However, Fromm's experience playing in high-pressure situations, such as the Little League World Series and the College Football Playoff National Championship, may give him an advantage.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fromm's success as a quarterback may also be attributed to his childhood experience playing baseball. Baseball teaches players to stay calm under pressure and make quick decisions, skills that are also valuable in football. Fromm's intelligence and decision-making skills may also be beneficial in his potential NFL start.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jake Fromm has had a unique career path since leaving college. Despite setbacks, such as a poor showing at the combine and a drop in completion percentage in his junior year, Fromm's past success and intelligence should not be overlooked. Now, with the possibility of making his first NFL start, Fromm's career may take a new turn. Fromm's experience playing in high-pressure situations and childhood experience playing baseball may give him an advantage. Whether he continues playing football or pursues a career outside of the sport, Fromm has a bright future ahead of him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkequtyp5kn6qforo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-poulter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Poulter Height, Weight, Measurements, Shoe Size</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-paul-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Paul Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
