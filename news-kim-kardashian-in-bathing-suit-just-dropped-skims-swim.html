One of the recent things she has begun doing is going for a run. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>She wrote on her Instagram story</span></a><span> that she had been going for runs every day. She also posted videos of herself doing sprints on her treadmill. "Been sprinting every day," she wrote. "I've been seeing changes!"

Despite this, the two are committed to doing a session together whenever they can. Even if it's at the crack of dawn. Alcantara told Women's Health, "Her schedule is crazy, and mine is also crazy, so we work out really early in the morning at 6 a.m." Working out first thing in the morning is great for people who have busy schedules, as it helps them stay consistent. It also is a good way to wake you up and get you energized for your day.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-988446470-1.jpg><p><span>For Kardashian, working out is all about variety. She does workouts that help her lose weight, and keep her heart healthy, but also does workouts that help her build muscle. Alcantara broke down the fitness routine she crafted to Kardashian to Women's Health. Alcantara described it as, "85 percent of our training is weight training, and the other 15 is made up of cardio. Kim loves to work the back of her legs—the hamstrings and the booty!" Doing two different workout styles is a great way to both keep yourself invested, but to also target multiple parts of your body.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-844516544.jpg><p><span>Working out is a commitment, and it's not always easy to make. However, according to Alcantara, Kardashian makes fitness a priority. Alcantara says that the reality star is extremely dedicated and always shows up for a session. "She's super responsible, she never cancels—she's the best client and athlete you can have," Alcantara told Women's Health. "It's just her drive. She's like, 'I have to work out, this is part of my life.' It's all about the mindset. Once [working out is] part of your daily routine and your life, then it's not something you have to think about, you just have to do it."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-1178072900.jpg><p><span>Kardashian suffers from psoriatic arthritis, which needs a lot of treatments.
