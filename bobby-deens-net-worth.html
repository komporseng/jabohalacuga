According to reliable sources, Bobby Deen’s net worth is estimated to be as high as $5 million. Apart from his restaurant management, Bobby has also appeared in several television shows such as “Paula’s Home Cooking” (2005-2008) and “Home for Dinner with Jamie Deen” (2012-2013) among others.</p><h3>Bobby Deen’s Net Worth – $5 Million</h3><p>Bobby’s upbringing in his hometown alongside his older brother was heavily influenced by his mother, the celebrated chef Paula Deen. It did not take long for the brothers to embark on their own culinary careers. Before stepping into the roles of chef and restaurateur, Bobby worked as a delivery boy for his mother’s cooking firm, Bag Lady. As their business flourished, he assumed more significant responsibilities, eventually leading to the establishment of their restaurant “Lady & Sons”.</p><p>Alongside his mother’s television career, he also started making appearances on television, both on his own and his mother’s shows. In 2006, he became the host of the show “Road Tasted” (2006-2007) and a year later joined his mother’s show “Paula’s Home Cooking”, featuring in 14 episodes until 2008. Additionally, in 2007, he co-hosted the show “Paula’s Party” (2007-2008) with Paula Deen. In 2012, he hosted his own show, titled “Home for Dinner with Jamie Deen”, which lasted for a single season. In the same year, he also hosted “Not My Mama’s Meals”. These ventures significantly contributed to the augmentation of his net worth. Furthermore, he made guest appearances on “The Chew” (2012-2015), in a total of six episodes, further amplifying his net worth.</p><p>Recent endeavors include hosting the show “Holiday Baking Championship” (2014-2015) and co-hosting “Junk Food Flip” (2015-2016). Additionally, he and his brother launched the show “Southern Fried Road Trip” (2015), thereby accruing a substantial sum to his net worth. During 2015 and 2016, he also hosted the show “Spring Baking Championship”, contributing further to his net worth.</p><p>His net worth has also grown through the release of books. He co-authored “The Deen Brothers Cookbook” with his brother Jamie and Melissa Clark, and “Y’all Come Eat / The Deen Brothers”, also with Jamie and Melissa.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Bobby has been married to Claudia Lovera since 2013, but further public details about this aspect of his life are scarce, as Bobby chooses to keep it private.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bobby Deen</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 28, 1970</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Albany, Georgia, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Chef, TV personality</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Valdosta State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Claudia Lovera (m. 2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Matthew James Deen, Jack Linton Deen</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Paula Deen, Jimmy Deen</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Jamie Deen</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Robert Deen</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/bobbydeen</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2265411/</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Road Tasted, Paula’s Party</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Stepson of Michael Groover.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Release of the book, “Y’all Come Eat / The Deen Brothers” by Bobby with Jamie Deen and Melissa Clark.
