The septuagenarian couple and Jill's 97-year-old mother, Lucia Arpino, were reportedly found dead on Sunday, June 25, at their residence in Massachusetts.</p><p>Described as "fantastic Italian people”, D'Amore and Jill were going to renew their wedding vows at Our Lady Help of Christians Church on their 50th wedding anniversary on Sunday. However, when they failed to show up, a worried friend went to check on them and discovered the gruesome crime. Authorities, who described the crime scene as bloody, have arrested their neighbor, Christopher Ferguson, in connection with the triple homicide. At the scene, officials discovered a bloody footprint and fingerprints that they matched to Ferguson, who had been spotted on surveillance footage in the area on Saturday night, June 24. The 41-year-old is currently facing one count of murder, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and burglary.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>'The greatest people you'd ever meet'</h2><p>The shocking deaths of the couple and Arpino sent shockwaves through the close-knit neighborhood.

He was also known for "his big voice and his exuberant personality." The letter further noted that Arpino never missed a 10 am mass and “for over 60 years she and her husband Alberto sat in the “North End” section of our church.”</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>'His wife was a delightful, shy person'</h2><p>Riley further noted that D'Amore “was really excited about planning” the renewal of their vows. “His wife was a delightful, shy person.
