Fans are now enraged to find how Charli, the TikTok sensation, was being portrayed by the magazine. The teen was seen donning a black lace bodysuit, in an article which was titled 'Charli Dâ€™Amelio Flaunts Her Undies In A Totally See-Through Lace Look'.</p><p>"Serving absolute body, Charli wore nothing more than a black set under a sheer lace bodysuit, with a pair of platform pumps," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the article</a> said, however the magazine has now changed their headline. Charli D'Amelio wore <a href=#>the outfit</a> for Machine Gun Kelly's launch party. The TikTok star, 17, also shared a photo of herself wearing <a href=#>the ensemble</a> on her <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Meghan Markle mocked by trolls over ill-fitting red dress at museum gala appearance</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Astroworld: Khloe Kardashian called 'satanic' for posting hot pics after tragedy</a></p><p>"Charli D'Amelio is currently repping my favorite of her many <a href=#>style personas</a>: that of angsty emo gf. She and Lil Huddy attended the official launch party of Machine Gun Kelly's new nail polish brand (potentially the most pop-punk sentence I've ever written in my life) <a href=#>dressed up</a> in their best grunge attire," the article, which has been widely criticized, reads.</p><h2 class=split><strong>What is social media saying?</strong></h2><p>Social media is enraged after the magazine released the article. "Hey @seventeen I understand you need an eye catching headline but charli dâ€™amelio is literally a minor so can you not do this," one user wrote. "@seventeen should be ashamed of themselves for posting such content about a 17 year old girl. This is disgusting. A disgrace to journalism. Do better, @seventeen. Apologize to Charli Dâ€™Amelio. Stop sexualizing underage girls with your clickbait content. #SEVENTEEN #charlidamelio," wrote another.</p><p>"I didnâ€™t click on it but Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re talking about an outfit she posted on Instagram and not her actual underwear but like what audience are you trying to attract with that title?" said one user, while another wrote, "</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I didnâ€™t click on it but Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re talking about an outfit she posted on Instagram and not her actual underwear but like what audience are you trying to attract with that title?</p>â€” Bianca ðŸ¥¨ (@heybiancaj) <a href=#>December 7, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>On an Instagram post discussing the same issue, one user wrote, "No news/gossip site should be making articles about someoneâ€™s underwear, thatâ€™s just creepy." "Fire the person who wrote this and fire whoever approved it," wrote one user. "The fact that they need to push topics like this in this manner to stay relevant or whatever," one user wrote, while another said, "The article was referring to an outfit she wore, which honestly? Was decently modest. It was more like a two piece body suit if weâ€™re being real. AND she wore a lace cover and a giant leather jacket. The headline was so unnecessary and creepy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5Wrsq%2FAxJ6lZqWRnK67tc2eZKykkaK6prCMn6arZZSewKjB0q2gp59dlr%2B1tcKlnGannmKwqa3RpaBmnF2Wuqa4yKhkpqGepL9uv8SxrJqkma%2B2r7OMrqWdnaKssqK%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./my-gist-partner-davido-says-as-he-gushes-over-chioma-rowland.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;My Gist Partner&amp;quot;, Davido Says As He Gushes Over Chioma Rowland</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./faith-ford.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Faith Ford Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
