The stuntwoman told The Las Vegas Review-Journal, “The last thing I said to him was, ‘I love you, honey, I’ll be with you when you get up from your nap. We were feeding him oranges and strawberries. He was so peaceful He said, ‘Yay!’ He had the purest and sweetest look on his face.”</p><p>On Facebook, Anastasia posted, “I am losing my honey beeps. I’m so sad and feel like this is carving a hole in my chest. He is COMPLETELY unresponsive. He is end-stage. Please give us peace at this time. Texting him or trying to call him needs to stop now, please.”</p><p>Anastasia also let his fans know that she has “beaten the odds for so long,” She added, “he is snuggled and loved by his girl constantly.
