He was unable to walk properly, or even wear clothes and felt isolated from society.</p><p>Opiyo first noticed a cyst growing on his genitals when he was 10 years old, in 2006. The next year he had the growth removed, but the infection returned a couple of years later, and his genitals began to swell again.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-137676 alt="Enlarged Penis Surgery" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/enlarged-penis-surgery.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-137676 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Muasya/Barcroft Image/ Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Forence Owiti Opiyo before his surgery.</span></p><p>He remembered how “This thing started very small, like a boil. Then it was the size of my fist. It just continued to grow bigger and bigger.”</p><p>For years, doctors were unable to diagnose Opiyo’s condition, as his genitals grew in size and his quality of life diminished. At one point, he even believed that he must have been cursed by the devil.</p><p>“The pain became increasingly unbearable so that I couldn’t even walk or sit,” Forence Owiti Opiyo recalled.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-137665 alt="11 Pound Testicles" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/opiyo-testicles.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-137665 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Immanuel Muasya/Barcroft/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Opiyo before the surgery.</span></p><p>But earlier this year, doctors at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Hospital in Kenya diagnosed Opiyo with scrotal elephantiasis and had him undergo surgeries to treat the disease.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephantiasis</a>, more properly known as lymphatic filariasis, is a condition that affects the lymphatic system. It is generally caused by roundworms that are transmitted to humans via mosquitoes.</p><p>These roundworms lodge themselves in lymphatic vessels leading to the swelling of tissue and thickening of the skin. These worms can live up to eight years and can continue to reproduce elongating the condition.</p><p>Those who suffer from this condition can develop intense swelling localized in one part of the body, in the case of Opiyo, in his genitals.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-137679 alt="Before Penis" width=900 height=505 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/before-penis.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-137679 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Muasya/Barcroft Image/ Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Forence Owiti Opiyo before his surgery.</span></p><p>Now, after removing the worms, the doctors performed two surgeries on Opiyo, the first to debulk his genitals and remove the excess mass, and a second to reconstruct the genitals into a more usual shape and size.</p><p>Dr. James Obondi, the consulting surgeon, said: “We spared the nerves, we spared the circulation and we brought the shaft to its rightful size.”</p><p>He said that “In three months [Opiyo] will be just normal in his functions and be able to do everything he wants to do.”</p><p>Following his recovery, Obondi said that Opiyo would be able to have a normal sex life and have children in the future.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-137666 alt="Forence Owiti Opiyo After" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/opiyo-after.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-137666 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Immanuel Muasya/Barcroft/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Opiyo after the surgery.</span></p><p>This was ecstatic news for Opiyo who said, “I would really love to have children one day, that is what I desire.”</p><p>After the surgery, Opiyo is delighted with returning to a normal life.</p><p>“Now I can run and I can play football.
