The show is about a diverse group of young people relocating to Austin, Texas to live in the same house.</p><p>In theory, there will be two residences side by side, with men and women living separately. They’re all on the move for various reasons: some want to find love, while others want to leave their parents’ houses and start their enterprises. Whatever the case may be, they’re all about to start a new chapter in their lives.</p><p>Netflix debuted the show’s scripting “Adulting in the twenty-first century is difficult. The pressure to find a career, find love, and make our way in the world might seem enormous. Having friends to lean on can make all the difference when your new job turns into a nightmare, when your hope turns to grief, and when you feel like you’ve lost your way.</p><p>In Austin, Texas, eight twentysomethings from around the country are leaving all they’ve ever known to take their first steps into adulthood. As they struggle to build a new life in The Lone Star State, these eight perfect strangers will form an unbreakable friendship.”</p><p><a href=#>Kamari Bonds</a>, Abbey Humphries, <a href=#>Bruce Stephenson</a>, Natalie Gable, <a href=#>Isha Punja</a>, Keauno Perez, and Michael Fractor are among the cast members joining Raquel Daniels.</p><h3><strong>Does Raquel Daniels Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Raquel Daniels took a shine to Kamari Bonds in the official teaser for “Twentysomethings: Austin.” They’re both young and gorgeous, so they might get along.

Back in 2009, she had a major crush on someone but mom and dad were reluctant about her having a boyfriend. She wrote a status on her Facebook, “Crushing MAJOR….but mom && dad say I can’t have a bf…..SUCKS.!”</p><p>But, based on her current social media posts, her relationship status is single.
