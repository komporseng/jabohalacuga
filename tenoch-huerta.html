He has acted in so many Latin American and Spanish movies, as well as he is also featured in several T.V series and in short films. He is one of the actors featured in <strong>Monica Maristain</strong><i>'</i>s<i> </i>book <i>30 Actors Made in Mexico</i>. Recently, he portrayed Rafael Caro Quintero in <i>Netflix</i>'s <i>Narcos: Mexico</i>.</p><p>Tenoch Huerta Mejia was born in Mexico City on <i>January 29, 1981</i>. His family is very supportive where his father enrolls him in an acting course and later on, he completed his bachelor in the degree of communication and journalism. Evidently, before his acting career, he used to be the cameraman.</p><h2>Relationship/Affairs</h2><p>Mexican charm Tenoch is one of the most eligible actors. Although he won millions of heart, still there are no signs of his relationship. In addition, he has no past records of any marriage or engagement also. In addition, he has maintained his social networking platform a bit low profile, so there is a proper report about his girlfriend or partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/16/kaegfdf-1581847425730.PNG><p>It seems like <i>39</i> years old, Tenoch is engaged in his career so that he could achieve more in his profession. His busy schedule and dedication to work may be the primary reason for not having any kind of relationship. Now let's have a glimpse of Mexican Net worth and earnings.</p><h2>Net Worth: 800,000</h2><p>The <i>39</i> years old, Huerta has earned a good amount of fortune and fame through his acting career, whereas, his estimated net worth as of <i>2020</i> is <strong>$800,000</strong>. Narcos Mexico is his most appreciated work where he worked with the actor like <a href=#><strong>Michael Pena </strong></a>and gained <strong>$70,000</strong> per episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/16/zxvadfd-1581847307530.jpg><p>Appearing in a variety of Hollywood hit movies like <i>Bel Canto, Debris, Tigers Are Not Afraid, </i>he must have gained millions of dollars. Besides his acting profession, he also earned a good portion of money through a different photoshoot for magazines cover as well as by promoting different brands but so far he has not revealed his actual income to the public.</p><h2>More about his Earnings and Incomes</h2><p>Probably, the journey of Huerta in the movie industry is not easy. He debuted from the Mexican movie <i>&nbsp;Así del precipicio</i> in <i>2006</i> where he got the role as a Window cleaner and had received only <strong>$1500</strong>. But his salary got skyrocketed from the success of a movie like <i>Camino</i> where he received<strong> $200,000</strong>.</p><figure class=table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Movies</strong></td><td><strong>Box Office Collection</strong></td></tr><tr><td><i>Camino</i></td><td><strong>$6 million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><i>The 33</i></td><td><strong>$26 million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><i>Cristiada&nbsp;</i></td><td><strong>$10 million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><i>Sleep Dealer</i></td><td><strong>$9 million</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Evidently, from his box office hits such as <i>Cristiada</i> and <i>Sleep Dealer,</i> he has also got around <strong>$250,000</strong> to <strong>$300,000</strong>. Except Hollywood movies and T.V series, he has also done the role in several Spanish movies.&nbsp;</p><h2>Netflix Series, Narcos: Mexico</h2><p>Most of us saw Tenoch in different character but recently we saw him as the modest Mexican weed farmer at the <i>Netflix</i> hit program <i>Narcos: Mexico </i>alongside<i> </i>actors<i> </i>like <a href=#><strong>Wagner Moura</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Diego Luna</strong></a>. Tenoch acts as Caro Quintero one of the most infamous drug traffickers. His love interest in the series is Sofía Conesa.</p><figure class=media></figure><p><i>Narcos: Mexico</i> explores the origins of the modern drug war by going back to its roots, starting at a time when the Mexican trafficking world was a loose, disorganized confederation of independent growers and dealers.</p><p><i><strong>Recommended </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> For More Trending News, Biography, And Gossips</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq2cp6eTnXqpwcSrq5o%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-gaines.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drake Gaines</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-carey.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Carey - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
