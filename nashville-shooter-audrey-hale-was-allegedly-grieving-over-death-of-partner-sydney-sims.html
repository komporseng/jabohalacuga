Both were on the same basketball team in school, but she died in a vehicle accident in 2022. One of the classmates who knew both of them said that Hale had been deeply impacted by the death of Sydney Sims. The 28-year-old school shooter, who was born biologically female identifies as transgender and preferred he/him pronouns, was reportedly heartbroken after her sudden demise.</p><p>Samira Hardcastle also claimed that “After Sydney’s tragic death, Audrey was really heartbroken over it … I just feel like she took it differently than some of us did. She was still posting about Sydney almost daily. What I knew of her was more admiring [Sydney]. Maybe even infatuation. That’s specifically who she really, really looked up to.” When she was asked about the time when she last saw Hale, Hardcastle told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NY Post</a> that they both met to tape together for their friend Avieranna Patton’s radio show. “I don’t think she was with anyone. She was just kind of by herself,” said Hardcastle before adding, “I don’t think that they were very close but I think Audrey looked up to [her] like she looked up to Sydney. But I don’t know that it was ever, like, a two-way thing.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Our trans youth are troubled': Nashville shooting sparks debate on identity and mental health issues in trans community</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Katherine Koonce: The Covenant School headmaster 'headed straight for' shooter Audrey Hale before being killed</a></p><h2 class=split>'This is my last goodbye'</h2><p>It was Patton whom he contacted in the minutes before his shooting spree. In his message the shooter wrote, “This is my last goodbye. I love you … See you again in another life.”In his message, he called Patton “the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen and known all my life,” and added “My family doesn’t know what I’m about to do. One day this will make more sense. I’ve left more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen.”</p><h2 class=split>'She had been openly grieving'</h2><p>Maria Colomy, an ex-instructor at the Nossi College of Art & Design in Nashville, who used to be Hale’s teacher as well, said his transition began just at the time when he was grieving Sims’death. “She had been openly grieving about that on social media, and during the grieving is when she announced that she wanted to be addressed as a male,” reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoppGotbe1y6WcZquYpLy1sdFmmK6coprGbrTApZxmr5GoeqK4y56enpycrnqovsieraKml2K8t7HRZpuemaSderCyjKmYq6yemr9uv9idpZ6xXai2rr8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-biasini.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Biasini</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inaki-godoy-scandal-and-viral-video-tiktok-reddit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Iaki Godoy Scandal And Viral Video TikTok And Reddit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
