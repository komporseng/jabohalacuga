The first season she watched fully was David vs. Goliath and soon she found the show to be “top dog!”.</p><p>When asked who she identifies concerning the former Survivor winner and non-winners, Maryanne hinted she might be playing a little bit of Sarah Lacina, Vecepia, Lauren Beck, Gabby Pascuzzi, and Debbie from season 32.</p><p>Looking back Maryanne said this one experience in life prepared her for the game.</p><p>This was when she had gone for her lifeguarding certificate because of this fear of water left by a nearly-drowning incident when she was a young child. Anyway, Maryanne shared she was the slowest swimmer there. Because she started late, everyone was younger than her and they did well. She on the other hand just failed and failed. Not wanting to give up so easily she kept pushing herself and on her seventh attempt, she finally got the timed swim. This very tenacity is what she said she would be relying on when surviving on the show.</p><h3><strong>Is Maryanne Oketch Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Until Valentine’s Day in 2022, Maryanne Oketch had been single for the 24th Valentine’s Day in a row.

As she disclosed all this, she ended the note positively saying she is anyway very happy in life.</p><h3><strong>Maryanne Oketch Parents</strong></h3><p>Survivor 42’s Maryanne Oketch was born to her parents Timothy and Consolata Oketch.</p><p>Meet Maryanne’s mother and hero, Consolata Oketch, who has been practicing her profession as a medical doctor since October 2009. Formerly a senior data analyst at Canadian Institute for Health Information, she did her MBChB at the University of Nairobi, MHSc at the University of Toronto and finally she completed her 2-year residency from Queen’s University in 2009.</p><p>Talking to CBS for Survivor, Maryanne revealed that her very hardworking mother was born into poverty in a village in Kenya as the youngest of five; she managed to get herself out of poverty and became a doctor in Kenya and provide for her mom; she gave that all up to support Maryanne’s father dreams; became a doctor in Canada while having three young children.</p><p>“My mom sacrificed and worked so hard to give her family a better life and never faltered from her dreams. I aspire to be like her. She changed my life”, Maryanne’s mother must be proud hearing her daughter say all this.</p><p>Maryanne’s father, Timothy Oketch, on the other hand, is a professional engineer with more than 20 years of working experience and a doctorate, master’s, and bachelor’s in Transporation Engineering.</p><p>As per siblings, Maryanne has a sister, Akinyi Oketch, and a brother named Joel Oketch.</p><h3><strong>Maryanne Oketch Height</strong></h3><p>Maryanne Oketch stands around 5’4” tall.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Maryanne Oketch?</strong></h3><p>When the world knew Maryanne as the contestant of surviving reality television show in 2022, she was 24 years old.</p><h3><strong>Maryanne Oketch Job</strong></h3><p>Maryanne Oketch was introduced to audiences on Survivor 42&nbsp;as a McMaster University seminary student.

Mary Anne aims to become a scientist following her graduation.</p><p>As for now, Maryanne continues to attend McMaster University for Integrated Science with a Biochemistry concentration! When entering university, she thought that she was going to focus her research on bacteria, but eventually, she decided to focus on Äìviruses instead.</p><p>Now, as we write this, she was looking forward to learning how full-time research works.
