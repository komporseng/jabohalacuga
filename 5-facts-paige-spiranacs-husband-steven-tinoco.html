The American social media personality, Spiranac, played college golf, winning All-Mountain West Conference honors. Additionally, she led the Aztecs to their first Mountain West Conference Champ in 2015.</p><p>Entertaining 2.8 million followers with her beautiful pictures and trick-shots videos, Paige thrives in her career as a social media personality. Besides that, Spiranac enjoys a blissful relationship with her fitness trainer partner, Steven Tinoco,&nbsp; We know one or two things about Paige, but her spouse prefers shedding light on her. Therefore, here are five facts about Paige Spiranac’s husband, Steven Tinoco.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Professional_Fitness_Trainer></span>Professional Fitness Trainer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The golf sensation, Paige Spiranac’s husband, <strong>Steven Tinoco</strong>, is a fitness enthusiast and a certified trainer. He has been working in the fitness world since 2017 for Six Zero Sox Fit. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to Tinoco’s LinkedIn</a>, he graduated from California State University with a degree in the Field of Study Criminal Justice and Corrections.</p><p>Years of training alongside the best trainers as an elite athlete have given Steven a unique fitness perspective. He further provides both training pieces in-person and online coaching that is accessible from any nook in the world.</p><p>Before working as a certified trainer, Spiranac’s beau worked as an assistant at Gold’s Gym for five years from 2010 to 2016. Hence, he came a long way before running his classes. Additionally, Steve’s professional career as a baseball player also aided his career transition as a fitness trainer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Former_Baseball_Player></span>Former Baseball Player<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aforementioned, Paige Spiranac’s husband is a certified trainer and a baseball player. The Tesoro High School graduate is a former minor league baseball player. Moreover, Steve was selected in the 34th round by the Tampa Bay Rays of the 2010 MLB Draft.</p><p>Furthermore, Steven played for Joplin Blasters for a year and Lincoln Pro Baseball-Saltdogs for two months in 2015. Likewise, he also played for Sioux Falls Canaries for a year from 2014/15.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Steven Tinoco (@s.tinoco606)</a> on Jun 9, 2013 at 8:09pm PDT</p><p>Besides being a former professional baseball player, Steven Tinoco also worked as a substitute child care leader at Saddleback Unified School District for four years. Similarly, Paige Spiranac’s mate was employed as a bartender at Rose Canyon Cantina for a year back in 2014.</p><p>Well, Steven has had a wide area of work experience before acknowledging his passion for fitness. And hence, today, he is serving as a result-oriented trainer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Little_Sneak-Peak_On_Spiranacs_Husband></span>A Little Sneak-Peak On Spiranac’s Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Well, Paige Spiranac’s life revolved around television and sports, as she belongs to a family with a sporty background. However, her spouse, Steven, comes from an average, non-flashy family that includes his mother and siblings.</p><p>Furthermore, Steven is very active on Instagram and proudly shares moments with his family and the love of his life. While going through Tinoco’s Instagram, we can see that he has a younger brother and a sister. He loves them dearly and has a great bond with one another. Growing up with his siblings seems to hold a special place in his heart.</p><p>Likewise, Steven Tinoco is a mama’s boy. He loves his mother and mentions her every once in a while. Similarly, he never forgets to wish his mom or sister or brother on their birthdays and invite them to every event he is a part of. Hence, Paige Spiranac’s husband is a family man and will raise a great family with her.</p><p><span style="font-family:open sans,Arial,Helvetica,nimbus sans l,sans-serif;font-size:24px">Met During The Starting Of Her Career</span></p><p>Love comes around in an unexpected turn of life, and such was the case with the golf’s sex symbol, Paige, and her spouse, Steven. Like every modern love story of this modern era, they met via the screen, loved one another’s vibe, and entered the relationship thing.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to the New York Times</a>, Tinoco’s wife had revealed that the pair met during the starting of her career. Furthermore, he seems pretty supportive of Paige’s aspirations. Moreover, the lovebirds rose to fame together, and interestingly, he even encourages her to show a little more cleavage. Talk about vibing together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Got_Engaged_On_A_Trip_To_Dubai></span>Got Engaged On A Trip To Dubai<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Paige and Steven were glowing together, Steven proposed his lady on a trip to Dubai in December 2016. They <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> their engagement via social media with 2.8 million and 5k followers combined.</p><p>However, the pair have kept their relationship details to themselves and refrained from showing their glory days with the world. Interestingly, Steven shares abundant pictures of them together while Paige has kept it professional as she seems to be earning from sponsorships.</p><p>Although the pair’s life seems glamourous via Instagram, Paige clarified that her private life with her partner is pretty serene. Not everything we see on social media is true, eh?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Got_Married_In_2018></span>Got Married In 2018<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paige is a beautiful human being with a godly body and soulful personality, and so is her soulmate, Steven Tinoco. Together, they make a gorgeous couple of beautiful faces, bodies, and characters.</p><p>Aforementioned, Paige and Steven got engaged in 2016 in Dubai. But the pair took time before walking down the aisle. Hence, they got married in 2018 secretly. Both Paige and Steven haven’t shared a clip of their wedding day but wished them on their first wedding anniversary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Paige-and-Steven.jpg><p>Steven Tinoco’s wife, Paige, was pretty disappointed because the one thing she wanted to keep to herself got exposed because of a foolish ex-boyfriend. Therefore, she must have willingly chosen to keep her wedding day to herself. Fair enough!</p><p>Although it has been two years since their marriage and several years of dating, the couple is yet to welcome their baby. Except, they adopted a fur baby in 2017.</p><p>Thus, let’s hope to see baby feet or fingers on both Spiranac and Tinoco’s Insta feed. Additionally, let’s also hope for the couple’s prosperity.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Entertainment</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>YouTubers</strong></a>, and&nbsp;<a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Movies TV Series</strong></a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>eCelebrityMirror</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcIGMn5icrKNivaK1xp5krKiZp66vrcKsZKGto5eur7CMrKuerpWjerW1zaiaqGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christabel-nettey-goal-chaser-hat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christabel Nettey &amp;quot;Goal Chaser&amp;quot; hat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scotty-mccreery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scotty McCreery Net Worth, Bio, Career, Married, Age, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
