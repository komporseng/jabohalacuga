However, behind the catchy upbeat melody and lyrics is a message that talks about the reality of unhappy relationships. The song is depicting that although the lead singer's partner still loves him, she may not want to be with him anymore, which is causing him to feel pain deep down inside. He mentions being grateful for his parents sticking together, as it appears he is not sure if he and his partner know how to do the same.</p><br><p>Later in the song, it talks about how the couple seems to have a difficult time accepting that their relationship is not working out, and this is what makes things very hard for them. They ignore the problems, and this makes their world very unhappy. The chorus suggests that the lead singer needs to let go of his pain and live in the moment instead, which is why he repeats the line, "Hey Ya!" multiple times. He wants to forget about his problems and stay in the present.</p><br><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>My baby don't mess around</u><br>My romantic partner doesn't play games with me</p><br><p><u>Because she loves me so</u><br>It's because of the love she has for me</p><br><p><u>And this I know fo sho (uh)</u><br>I'm absolutely certain of this fact</p><br><p><u>But does she really wanna</u><br>I wonder if she truly wants to be with me</p><br><p><u>But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
