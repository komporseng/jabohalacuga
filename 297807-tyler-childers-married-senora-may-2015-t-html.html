The couple has been married since 2015 and announced the happy news at a Kentucky festival in April 2022.</p><p class=dh>May has announced that she will be taking it easy throughout 2022 and leaving the singing and guitar playing to her husband while she prepares for the arrival of their new baby towards the end of the year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/270c5af9e29675407bccf02bc9c517a8.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Senora May and Tyler Childers at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2020 in Los Angeles. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Whether the Childers baby is a boy or a girl, we can practically guarantee it will have a great voice -- it's in the genes. Mommy and daddy are both singer-songwriters and play mean guitar, so there will be plenty of lullabies for Childers Junior.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://senoramaymusic.com/about>Senora May</a> is a country girl, born in Irvine, Kentucky, on May 29, 1991. One of six children raised by a single mom, May grew up playing in the woods and fishing with her brothers. Her music is a curious blend of folk and country with a South American dash of heat and the echoes of the outdoors she loves.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The couple struggled in their first years of marriage. They bought an old camper and lived with no electricity and no running water.</strong></h3><p class=dh>She released her first album, "Lainhart," in 2018, a year after her husband released his breakthrough album "Purgatory," and made his mark in the music business. From then on, the couple's careers blossomed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1e44163d800d04b2d0187eb7574cb36e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tyler Childers on stage during a concert at the Columbia Theater in 2020 in Berlin, Germany. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>He Learned How to Sing in Church</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Like his wife, Senora May, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://theboot.com/tyler-childers-country-music-bio-facts/>Tyler Childers</a> was born in Kentucky into a profoundly religious family, and it was religion that led him to his love of music. He admitted that his family is not musical, but Childers joined the church choir and learned to sing.</p><p class=dh>His uncle, a preacher, taught him his first guitar chords and awakened the talent that has led him to stages around the world and in the USA. Like May, his main inspiration is his country home and the Appalachian mountains where he grew up.</p><p class=dh>Critics struggle to label Childers' musical genre and waver between grassroots country and folk music -- something they call Americana. Since then, Childers has released three more studio albums, "Country Squire," "Long Violent History," and "Can I Take My Hounds to Heaven?" in 2022. Childers was nominated for <a class="me a" href=#>a GRAMMY Award</a> in 2020.</p><p class=dh>Eager fans who have been waiting for Childers' new album will have to take a breather. It is likely that the singer will be very involved in becoming a dad and childrearing fro the next year or so.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Senora May Was Influenced by Beyonce and Has Deep South American Roots</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>May, whose family is originally from South America, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/09/senora-may/>acknowledges the influence</a> of Latin sonority in her music, alongside Emmylou Harris, Nina Simone, Feist, and one special lady. May <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CC8npVulTgE/>revealed</a> on Instagram:</p><p class=dh>“I’m so excited for this I can hardly stand it. Not sure why anyone would ask why I like @beyonce …She’s my Queen.”</p><p class=dh>May's grandmother was from Columbia and raised her mother in Miami. It was May's parents who settled in Kentucky. She recalls her mother singing to her in Spanish, and it was she who encouraged her to explore her creativity.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>May & Childers Met When She Was a Student</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>May went to Berea College, a liberal arts school in Kentucky, and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.linkedin.com/in/senora-childers-89761952/>graduated in 2013</a> with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Ecological Architecture. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/09/senora-may/>met Childers</a> while she was a student. He worked on a farm, and May cleaned houses to pay for college. Childers <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ott-tyler-childers-0209-story.html>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>“I was living out on this farm with a 65-year-old dude and this angel walks in.”</p><p class=dh>Childers raves about his wife, whom he credits with making him a responsible, accountable man. His admiration for his "Lady May" knows no bounds, and he revealed that she is as talented a painter, stained glass artist, and writer as a singer.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>May & Childers Started a Relief Fund to Benefit Appalachian Communities</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/7eMr-Tv7pW/>struggled</a> in their first years of marriage. They bought an old camper and lived with <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/09/senora-may/>no electricity</a> and no running water. May had to haul buckets of water from a nearby stream for washing and bathing.</p><p class=dh>The Childers knew how difficult life could be, so they founded the Hickman Holler Appalachian Relief Fund. Appropriately, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hickmanhollerappalachianrelieffund.org/faq>the Fund</a> has provided water crisis relief in Kentucky's Martin County and donated 12,000 bottles of water to the population.</p><p class=dh>The Fund is also dedicated to raising money for social justice, a college scholarship for Kentucky residents, and subsidizing organizations combating the opioid crisis in the Appalachian mountains.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Couple Expecting Their First Baby Together</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>May announced her pregnancy on stage in her native Irving, Kentucky, at the Mountain Mushroom Festival on April 23, 2022.

Childers and May haven't announced the date of delivery, but counting on the date of the announcement, their baby will most probably be born in December 2022.</p><p class=dh>May has posted several photos on Instagram sharing her and Childers' delight in the pregnancy. The singer is looking more beautiful than ever and glowing. We will keep the couple's fans updated on the progression of the pregnancy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcHBgbHq1xcueqWabmJ65pbHRrGSmmaKntqawjKycp6eilnqurdhmaWlpZWLBb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vegas-by-joseline-hernandez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vegas By Joseline Hernandez: Original Video For I Wanna Ride I Wanna Ride TikTok Song Meaning</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./live-nation-partners-with-mohegan-gaming-entertainment-to-bring-entertainment-to-project-inspire-in-south-korea.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Live Nation Partners With Mohegan Gaming &amp;amp; Entertainment To Bring Entertainment To Project Inspire I</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
