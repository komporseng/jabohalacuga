When Kevin saw Kattie walk through the door, he felt compelled to speak with her. They hit it off right away and eventually started dating. Kevin and Kattie pose for Marrying Millions together.</p><p>Despite his massive net worth of $50 million, Kevin appeared to be extremely frugal when it came to spending on his girlfriend. This was evident in one of the preview clips when Kevin took Kattie to a restaurant and then suggested splitting the bill. In another preview clip, when Kattie asked David if he had $1,000 to lend her and pay her rent, David replied, “If I had a ‘normal person’ job, you wouldn’t ask me.”</p><p>Not only did such an incident enrage Kattie’s friends, but many Marrying Millions of fans were also irritated by Kevin’s behavior. “Run, girl, run!” wrote one Instagram user. In the meantime, another user stated, “I would never have dated a guy like him.” Yes, it is essential in a relationship to contribute equally to living expenses and bills as a couple sharing the same space. But that’s a hefty restaurant bill! How can this man be so stingy with the woman he ostensibly loves?!!!”</p><p>The Marrying Millions fanbase did not see them getting engaged and married as the season progressed. Kattie insisted David didn’t want his money when he moved to Las Vegas and left her in San Diego. At the same time, David was concerned that she would seek out someone who could better care for her.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Read More: </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Karla Monroig</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Sabina Gadecki</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Deborah Kaplan</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Jaclyn Betham</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Park Shin Hye</span></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Edward Lloyd</a></h3>Edward Lloyd estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
