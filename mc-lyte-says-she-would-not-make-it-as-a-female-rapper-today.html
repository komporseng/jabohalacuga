It’s that type of thing where everybody’s giving Rockettes and Vegas showgirl flavor.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>MC Lyte will star in “Partners In Rhyme” on the Allblk network.<span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>Lil Kim started to bring sex into female rap in the 1990s, but a recent wave of stars including Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj have found phenomenal success wearing skimpy stage clothes and making racy videos.</p><p>“I’m happy that anyone feels great in their body. Perhaps if I had a different type of body I would be like, ‘Hey see this?,’” the 51-year-old said, “However my walk has been extremely different from that in the very beginning. I didn’t want people to look at me. I wanted them to hear me because I had something to say and I wanted them to pay attention to my words.”</p><p>And when asked about any past desired to have plastic surgery, Lyte — who’s real name is Lana Moorer — says she “never felt the pressure” to do so.</p><p>“I never felt the pressure to do any plastic surgery. I actually might have the smallest butt in the industry and it’s OK, it’s mine, it belongs to me. If I had the guts I might do something different but all the horror stories I hear I rather just go ahead drop and do some squats.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>Brooklyn rapper MC Lyte wore baggy pants and shirts at the start of her music career.<span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The “Ruffneck” artist is considered one of the many pioneers in hip hop, particularly for her storytelling rhyme style. Also known for her gold chains and door knocker earrings paired with baggy jeans and oversized shirts — the popular street style of the time — as well as on stage.</p><p>The rapper says that she blames mainstream culture seeping into the old school hip hop underground, and bringing Hollywood’s male gaze with it.</p><p>“Everything we have seen in hip hop we have seen in the movies forever; we seen on television. We literally to this day still see woman in a lot of nothing holding up cards prancing around a boxing ring to say, ‘This Round One, Round Two, Round Three,’” she said, “It’s not anything new — it’s just that the powers that be have found a way to monetize hip hop to the umpteenth power and that’s why using every tactic that they were already used in other forms of media.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>MC Lyte, pictured here in 1991, was the first female MC to release an album.<span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>She told us that she wished that talented underground female rappers like Rhapsody and Tierra Whack could get more mainstream attention, even though they don’t shine a spotlight on their bodies.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s a lot of time, effort, money, marketing and branding going into those artists. It’s much easier to sell sex than anything else,” she said.</p><p>MC Lyte’s new sitcom “Partners in Rhyme” will stream on Allblk network begining Nov. 18.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnZh6rcXTnmSsmamoerS0xGauqK2cmXqvu9NmpJqjlWK2tXnArGSaZZaauqK4xGapmqigmr9uwM6dmLJnb6rBrqvSqKyrm5Vyv7S%2Fha6rppedmrGqwcx2qayrVqrBrqvCmqSpmZmcu365wmajsqyVYsCixdJmqqGdXay8trjDZqWorF2irqyxjKKrZpmjYq5ussSmmKWdXaeusbzEq2Stp5SWxg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shinji-nakano.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shinji Nakano Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-viper-room.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside The Viper Room, Hollywood's Notorious Rock Club</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
