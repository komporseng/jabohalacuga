Here’s everything you need to know about it.</strong></p><p>In recent days, Riot Games has made several changes to the game, including many Agent-buffs and nerfs and major map updates. Moreover, the developers have been improving the in-game features by introducing Spray Wheel and more.</p><p>Riot Games, however, isn’t done&nbsp;adding new content to the game, as demonstrated by recent announcements, indicating&nbsp;that more exciting updates are on the way.</p><p>The Episode 7 update will include a new game mode, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT’s take on the Team Deathmatch. </a>Not to mention, in the same Episode, a new Agent will join the game. To spice things up, VALORANT is introducing a new progression system for the players, which will also debut on June 27, 2023.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VCT Masters 2023 Tokyo: Format, Teams, Schedule & More</a></strong></p><h2 id=valorant8217s-new-progression-system class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">VALORANT’s New Progression System</h2><p>Riot Games is making several changes to the progression system with the Episode 7 update. The new system will include <strong>daily reward changes, Kingdom Credits, Agent recruitment event, Agent gear, and Accessories Store.</strong> Let’s find out what to expect from each of these changes.</p><h3 id=daily-reward-changes class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Daily Reward Changes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/daily-rewards.jpg><p>VALORANT will now give you better rewards for playing the game every day. Players can get these rewards by playing any game mode in the game, including the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new TDM</a>. Apart from the regular XP bonuses, players will now receive daily bonuses consisting of Kingdom Credits. Moreover, there’ll be weekly missions set for players every week. One can complete these missions to earn some extra XP and Kingdom Credits.</p><h3 id=kingdom-credits class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Kingdom Credits</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kingdom-credits.jpg><p>Kingdom Credit is a new currency type being added in VALORANT from Episode 7. Players can earn these Kingdom Credits just by playing the game. The daily bonuses can also give you extra Kingdom Credits. Players can use Kingdom Credits to unlock new Agents or purchase Agent gear and other cosmetic items from the accessories store.</p><h3 id=agent-recruitment-event class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Agent Recruitment Event</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/age.jpg><p>Starting from Episode 7, there’ll be no more Agent Contracts and will be replaced by the Agent Recruitment Event. Sometimes, players forget to activate an Agent Contract and keep playing the game, which wastes a lot of time. Plus, players can’t enjoy a new Agent as soon as possible without buying the Agent with VP.</p><p>However, that’ll change with Episode 7. The Agent Recruitment Event will automatically start when a new Agent is released. The event will stay active for a few weeks. And if you earn enough XP, you’ll be able to unlock the new Agent for free. Like before, you can still buy the Agent using 1000 VP. But what happens when you can’t unlock the Agent via the Agent Recruitment Event?</p><p>Don’t worry! While you’re progressing through the Agent recruitment Event, you’ll still earn Kingdom Credits that’ll store in your KC balance. After the Agent Recruitment Event is expired, you can use 8000 Kingdom Credits anytime and unlock that specific Agent or any locked Agent from the Agent store.</p><h3 id=agent-gear class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading">Agent Gear</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gear.jpg><p>What happens to all the free rewards that you earn by completing an Agent contract? They’re all there. But the good news is that you don’t have to complete the entire contract to earn a specific item from the contract.</p><p>From Episode 7, you can choose any item from any tier and unlock it using Kingdom Points. So, basically, you can unlock a Tier 10 weapon for any Agent using 8000 Kingdom Points without unlocking the previous tiers first. However, remember that just like the XP requirement, the KC requirement in each tier will increase.</p><h3 id=accessories-store class="rb-heading-index-5 wp-block-heading">Accessories Store</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/accessory-store.jpg><p>You can always go to VALORANT’s in-game store and look into the Offers section to find any previously released weapon skin and melee. But unfortunately, there’s no option to purchase previously released accessories like Playercards, Buddies, Titles, and Sprays.</p><p>Starting from Episode 7, players can buy previously released accessories from the new Accessories Store. However, only the previously released Battlepass accessories will be available for purchase. You can buy these accessories via Kingdom Credits.</p><p>The accessories store will reset every week, so keep your eyes open for your favorite Cards, Buddies, Titles, and Sprays.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT Karma Give Back Bundle 2023: Confirmed Skins, Price, Release Date & More</a></strong></p><p>VALORANT has a lot in store for its player base in Episode 7.
