They tracked those figures across time and incorporated historical factors and events which ranged from disease and warfare to slavery and the eventual collapse of native society.</p><p>The research showed a shocking reduction in population from 60 million by the end of the 15th century — which was around 10 percent of the world’s population at the time — to five or six million within 100 years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-205385 alt="Burial At Wounded Knee" width=900 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/burial-at-wounded-knee.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-205385 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Burial of the dead after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massacre at Wounded Knee</a>, 1891.</span></p><p>In order to link that data to carbon uptake, Koch’s team had to assess how much Native American land had been abandoned and been reclaimed by nature in order to match that to our current understanding of global cooling data during that period.</p><p>What they found were 56 million hectares, an area of land which is about the size of France, left untended after those who previously lived on it had died. The subsequent regrowth of trees and vegetation is said to have caused an atmospheric CO2 decrease of between 7 and 10ppm (parts per million).</p><p>“To put that in the modern context — we basically burn (fossil fuels) and produce about 3ppm per year,” said co-author, Professor Mark Maslin. “So, we’re talking a large amount of carbon that’s being sucked out of the atmosphere.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-205383 alt="Nuclear Cooling Towers" width=900 height=541 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nuclear-cooling-towers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-205383 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><span class=caption-body>Nuclear cooling towers, 2010.</span></p><p>The Industrial Revolution in the 20th century has often been cited as the beginning of catastrophic, man-made climate change, but Reading University professor Ed Hawkins is adamant that additional factors must always be considered.</p><p>“This new study demonstrates that the drop in CO2 is itself partly due to the settlement of the Americas and resulting collapse of the indigenous population, allowing regrowth of natural vegetation,” he said. “It demonstrates that human activities affected the climate well before the industrial revolution.”</p><p>The study implies that nature can also effectively impact global temperatures by mere reforestation and healthy vegetation. This has left Hawkins — who studies climate change — curious about its potential applications. On the other hand, it also clarifies just how emissions-heavy our contemporary world has become.</p><p>“What we see from this study is the scale of what’s required, because the Great Dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few ppm,” he said. “This is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same time, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate.”</p><p>While making an effort to challenge that present rate is arguably most important at this juncture, the University College of London study certainly proffers a strong argument to look back at history for clues, warnings, and advice.</p><p>After reading about how colonization of the Americas caused the Little Ice Age, read about how huge sections of <a href=#>Australia’s Great Reef</a> are dying because of climate change. Then, read about <a href=#>the man who tracked down the person who killed his great-grandfather</a> during Stalin’s Great Purge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyttdOto55lmZiybq3GnmScmaWosg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./foaming-shower-gel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Highest-Rated Foaming Shower Gel of 2023 Hollywood Life Reviews Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-tewes-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Tewes Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
