But among all the chaos, fans are certainly missing one particular contestant who would've aced it in the upcoming immunity challenge.</p><p>Parvati Shallow won the When it Rains, it Pours challenge twice before when she previously appeared on 'Survivor'. She is also the first person to have won the same individual challenge more than once. Prior to Wednesday's episode, the series shared a sneak peek of what fans can expect.</p><p>One of the pictures teased that there's a new challenge that is coming to the contestants on the Edge of Extinction. We haven't seen a lot from the castaways who are in EoE.</p><p>Among all the pictures was a picture of the immunity challenge.&nbsp;This is a throwback challenge to where the contestants will have to one hand high in the air for as long as they can.</p><p>As each player drops their hand, they will get dunked with water, until one contestant remains standing. This challenge is also known to be a classic Survivor challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>While fans were excited to see what the episode holds, they also shared that they miss Parvati because she would've killed this challenge. Parvati was one of the castaways voted out during tribal council and sent to the Edge of Extinction.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking to Twitter a fan wrote, "Too bad Parvati won't get a shot at this challenge. @parvatishallow." Another said, "Imagining Parvati slaying all these immunity challenges #Survivor."</p><p>"Queen Parvati would kill that immunity challenge," a fan shared while another added, "damn they using Parvati's challenge and she ain't even in the game #Survivor."</p><p>"Parvati doing this challenge for 6 hours & she's on the edge are you kidding," a fan wrote. Another fan added, "I'm sorry but Parvati would've won almost all these immunity challenges.... the floating triangle, the infamous pole and now the hand above the head... WE COULDVE HAD THREE PARV IMMUNITY WINS ALREADY #Survivor40 #survivor."</p><p>"Parvati would've won this easily. I think if she made the merge she would’ve ran the immunity challenges. #Survivor," a fan shared. Another said, "CBS actually was looking out for our queen Parvati giving them the pole comp and then this is ******* fault. period. #Survivor."&nbsp;</p><p>"I just keep thinking about how good Parv would've been at that challenge. She could've gotten 3 for 3. Alas we will never know. Maybe they should've let her do it just for pride," a fan wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Reddit</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq6Wnw6rCzqtksKGeo7Kzv4yaq2avkad6tLHArKanZWRleqe%2ByJ6lnatdlsFussirnGaooprDqrHWZqeaqqaWwap50qGYpaSfrHqqucyupaKsqWKwqa3LpZynn5VisrCx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./court-newcomb-obituary-fort-wayne-in-court-newcomb-death-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Court Newcomb Obituary, Fort Wayne IN, Court Newcomb Death Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-roseanne-barrs-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Roseanne Barr's Net Worth in 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-shwartzman.html>Robert Shwartzman</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-about-sam-mendes-net-worth-relationship-career.html>All About Sam Mendes | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./darez-diggs.html>Darez Diggs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-messi-play-in-2024-copa.html>Will Messi Play in the 2024 Copa America?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dianna-agron-topless-pics-glee-brian-bowen-smith-photo-shoot.html>[PHOTOS] Dianna Agrons Topless Pics Glee Star Strips For Brian Bowen Smith Hollywoo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
